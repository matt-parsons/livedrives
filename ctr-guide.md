Our Guide to Successful CTR Campaigns
The Goal: The most important thing is to make your business look like a popular, legitimate choice to Google. Our strategy is to blend targeted searches for your main services with natural-looking activity. This guide shows you how to do that safely.

Step 1: Create Your Campaign
First, we need to tell the system about your business.

Click to create a new campaign.
Fill in your business details.
Crucially, add your business's CID number by pasting the Google Place URL in the software.
Pro Tip: After you save, go to the Keywords map and double-check that the pin is in the correct location for your business.
Step 2: Generate Your Keyword Lists with AI
This is the most important step. We will use the following prompt in a tool like ChatGPT to automatically create the perfect keyword lists for you.

Part A: Gather Your Information
First, collect the following details. You will need them for the prompt.

[Business Name]: Your exact company name.
[Core Services]: A simple list of what you do (e.g., emergency plumbing, heating repair, drain cleaning).
[Primary Location]: Your main city and state/region (e.g., NYC, Sydney NSW).
[Confusing Brand Name]: The name of another big company people might confuse you with. If none, write None.
[Raw Keyword List]: Go to your Google Business Profile > Performance dashboard. Select the last 3-6 months and copy the entire list of keywords and their search volumes.
Part B: Use the AI Prompt (or the custom GPT)
Option 1: You can use this CustomGPT and paste your entire list of keyword from your GBP performance data into it and it will help you by writing a list of keywords for you.

This GPT is based upon the prompt below, you can alter this prompt if you like, but the custom GPT works pretty well in our experience.

Option 2: Copy the entire prompt (click-here) and paste it into ChatGPT. Replace the bracketed [...] information with the details you gathered in Part A.

You can also just use your list of keywords from Google Business Profile and ask AI to fill out this prompt for you.

Part C: Review the AI Output
The AI will give you three lists. They should contain approximately:

Branded: 10-20 Keywords
Money/Primary: 5-15 Keywords
Longtail: 50-100+ Keywords
Step 3: Add Your Keywords to the Campaign
Now that you have your lists, simply copy the comma-separated keywords from the AI output and paste them into the matching keyword groups in your campaign setup.

Step 4: Set Your Daily Traffic (Use These Exact Settings)
Choose one of these two starting configurations. Do not start higher than this.

Case 1: For NEW Listings (or businesses with low traffic)
Total Daily Searches: 7 (5 from Maps, 1 from Map Pack, 1 from Driving Directions)
How to Distribute Your Searches:

Brand Keywords: 3 searches/day
Money Keywords: 2 searches/day
Longtail Keywords: 2 search/day
Case 2: For ESTABLISHED Listings (already getting calls/traffic)
Total Daily Searches: 12 (10 from Maps, 2 from Map Pack, 2 Driving Directions)
How to Distribute Your Searches:

Brand Keywords: 6 searches/day
Money Keywords: 4 searches/day
Longtail Keywords: 2 searches/day
Step 5: Monitor and Make Small Adjustments
Let the campaign run. Do not make changes for at least 2-3 weeks. Let the system work.

It is OPTIONAL to add traffic and if you are adding traffic, you should be monitoring your campaigns weekly. If you do not add traffic, the campaigns will still benefit from the signal we are sending. More traffic = more signal and more risk so it's up to your appetite and willingness to monitor campaigns.

If Rankings Are Improving After 2-3 Weeks:
GO SLOW: You can increase your traffic settings by a very small amount.
Rule of Thumb: Add 1-2 total daily searches every 2 weeks. Distribute them proportionally based on the ratios in Step 4.
If Rankings Become Volatile (Jumping Up and Down):
This is a normal sign that you've hit your limit. It's easy to fix.

Immediately decrease traffic back to the last known stable level.
Clean up your keywords: Remove any "Money" keywords that are ranking very poorly (e.g., position 20+).
Let it run for another 2 weeks to stabilize.
